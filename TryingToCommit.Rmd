I'm an R Markdown document! I can write whatever I want to write.

# Section 1 

Here's section 1 

## Subsection 1.1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_ : 

```{r generate_sample, message = FALSE} 
library(tidyverse)

samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp) 

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(100)
)
```

# Section 2 

I can take the men of the sample, too! 
The mean is `r mean(samp)`. 

```{r}
mean(samp) 
```

```{r named_code_chunk}
set.seed(100)
samp = rnorm(500, mean = 1)

plot_df = tibble( 
  x = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
  y = c(x > 0),
  abs_val = abs(x)
  )

plot_df

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=abs_val)) + geom_histogram()

median(plot_df[[1]])
```

The median is `r median(samp)`.
